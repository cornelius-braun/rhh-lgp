# RHH-LGP

This repository contains the implementation of the RHH-LGP algorithm for task and motion planning (TAMP) that is presented in the research paper 

**RHH-LGP: Receding Horizon And Heuristics-Based Logic-Geometric Programming For Task And Motion Planning** 

by Cornelius V. Braun, Joaquim Ortiz-Haro, Marc Toussaint and Ozgur S. Oguz.

## How to use
`git clone git@github.com:cornelius-braun/rhh-lgp.git --recursive`

For information on how to run the RAI code, please look at the readme in the *rhhlgp-rai* submodule. Please make sure that you are on the *master/cornelius* branch of the *rhhlgp-rai* submodule. If you clone the repository using the command above, this will automatically be the case.

## Supplementary material
The supplementary material contains one [video](https://youtu.be/6IhFuwuDYz8) presenting demonstrations of the investigated tasks and another [video](https://youtu.be/1Y9MPukb_7o) showing the design pipeline and the results of the iterative control optimization in the paper.
